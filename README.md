My goal is to write some algorithms to solve this problem, and to write some simulation code to test the algorithms. The task is to find the shortest possible way to rearrange N checkers so all the red checkers precede the black ones. We'll count efficiency by minimizing the number of swaps done by the algorithm, and we're only allowed to swap and inspect the color of the checkers.


I want to solve this problem using Python classes, and I want to try to write an animation that displays the algorithm working, so I can inspect it and also practice my data visualization skills.

If you have somehow found this repository, welcome!
